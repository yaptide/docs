# Geometry

The geometry is composed of the following elements:

  * list of abstract figures (boxes, cylinders, spheres, etc.). The figures are defined by their position and size and has no material assigned to them.
  * list of zones. The zones are defined by the boolean operations on the abstract figures and have assigned material.

An example geometry is shown below:
